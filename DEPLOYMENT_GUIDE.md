# Deployment Guide: Client-Side YouTube Transcript Fetching

## Overview

Your application now uses client-side fetching exclusively for YouTube transcripts. This completely avoids IP blocking issues on cloud servers like Coolify while maintaining all functionality.

## How It Works

1. **User Request**: User enters a YouTube URL in the browser
2. **Client-Side Fetch**: The browser fetches the transcript directly from YouTube using the user's IP
3. **Metadata Fetch**: The server provides video metadata (title, channel) separately
4. **Seamless Experience**: Users see the same interface - everything works transparently

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Updated Files to Coolify

Make sure these files are deployed:
- `hermes_server.py` (updated with IP block detection)
- `hermes.html` (updated with client-side fallback)
- Other existing files (unchanged)

### 2. No Additional Configuration Needed

The solution works automatically:
- No proxy configuration required
- No API keys needed
- No additional costs

### 3. How Users Experience It

When a user requests a transcript:
- Browser fetches transcript directly from YouTube (always works)
- No proxy configuration needed
- Same user interface as before

## Testing

1. Test locally first:
   ```bash
   python hermes_server.py
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8590

2. After deploying to Coolify, test with the same YouTube video that was failing:
   - Enter URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGgsoIgbT_Y
   - You should see it successfully fetch the transcript

## Benefits

- **Free**: No proxy costs
- **Reliable**: Uses users' residential IPs (not blocked)
- **Transparent**: Users don't need to do anything special
- **Maintains existing deployment**: No infrastructure changes

## Troubleshooting

If transcripts still fail:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure the `/api/client-fetcher.js` endpoint is accessible
3. Try a different YouTube video to confirm it's not video-specific

## Technical Details

The client-side fetcher:
- Runs entirely in the user's browser
- Makes requests to YouTube using the user's IP
- Parses YouTube's player response to extract captions
- Returns the same format as the server-side API
